- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Praveen Jha,

I have been developing web and mobile applications since 2013. In particular, I have experience in building apps for the IoT industry, shopping apps, messengers, mobile social networks.
I can architect any application from scratch by following well-established development practices defined by the Android and iOS dev community and Google. I can also work in a team of developers with such development processes as code reviews, git branching models, issue tracking, etc. I have also supported and improved apps with legacy code.

I am keen on clean code and testing. Following SOLID principles makes a project easy to read and maintain for developers. Testing code as early as possible adds up to a bug-free application.
I prefer long-term contracts and projects that have rich functionality. I am also interested in project leadership and I am keeping an eye on modern technologies like Kotlin Multi-platform and Flutter.
